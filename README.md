# py-maze-crawler
This script is a 3D maze exploration game using the turtle module to draw the graphics. The aim of the game is to take the player to the red finish flag. The maze is stored in a 2D list, and drawn onto the screen depending on where the player is in the maze. An implementation of random depth first search is used to generate the mazes. 

This was made as an implementation of several simple vector based sprite commands I made for the turtle module, the game updates based on inputs, perhaps one day I will evolve this into frame based updates, but that would likly involve some other way of keeping track of inputs as turtle is a little funky with that.
